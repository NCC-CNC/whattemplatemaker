#' whattemplatemaker: Interactive data template application for the What To Do application
#'
#' The What Template Maker is a tool that creates data templates for the What
#' To Do application. Since the What To Do application requires data in a very
#' specific format, this application is designed to help with preparing input
#' data for the What To Do application. After providing the names of sites,
#' features, and actions, a template Excel Spreadsheet can then be downloaded
#' from this application. The template Excel Spreadsheet can then be populated
#' with data (e.g. longitude/latitude of sites) and, subsequently, uploaded to
#' the What To Do application.
